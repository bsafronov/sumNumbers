# sumNumbers
small test task

This program is looking for how to get the desired value from an array of numbers from N-1 to 0 through the operators =, - and merge.

For example: 
NumbersCount = 10; // [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

DesiredValue = 200;

Result: 9-8-7-6-5+4+3+210=200

The task uses the simplest algorithm for iterating over values
